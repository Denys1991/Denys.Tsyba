                Who is your user? Indicate her KEY personality traits and help round out her overall image. <br> <br>
                Originally, the personality section of this persona was based off the Myers Briggs personality test. According to the
                Myers Briggs, there are 16 potential user personality types. Our template integrates questions from this online
                personality test example into a series of sliding bar graphics. If you’re confused as to what the sliders mean, check
                out the Myers Briggs basics article.

                In the beginning, It’s just about brainstorming. <br> <br>
                I list out a jumble of words and draw tiny sketches related to what I’m working on (and find the parallels later).
                Personally, I prefer paper with a grid so I can convey things responsively. Most of the time perfection isn’t an issue
                and the sketches are just for me.

                I played with adding a wireframe of the website flow that would lead you in to each screen. For each of those screens I
                added a floating footer that allows users to see where they are in that particular flow and jump around as needed.”
                We’re digging this InVision-made wireframe.
